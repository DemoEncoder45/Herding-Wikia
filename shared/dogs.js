        description: "Among the most agreeable of all small housedogs, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a strong, athletic, and lively little herder who is affectionate and companionable without being needy. They are one the world's most popular herding breeds. At 10 to 12 inches at the shoulder and 27 to 30 pounds, a well-built male Pembroke presents a big dog in a small package. Short but powerful legs, muscular thighs, and a deep chest equip him for a hard day's work. Built long and low, Pembrokes are surprisingly quick and agile. They can be red, sable, fawn, and black and tan, with or without white markings. The Pembroke is a bright, sensitive dog who enjoys play with his human family and responds well to training. As herders bred to move cattle, they are fearless and independent. They are vigilant watchdogs, with acute senses and a 'big dog' bark. Families who can meet their bold but kindly Pembroke's need for activity and togetherness will never have a more loyal, loving pet."

        description: "These resilient herders are intelligent enough to routinely outsmart their owners. Standing between 17 to 20 inches at the shoulder, the Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, hard-muscled herder of strength and agility. The ACD is born with a white coat that turns either blue-gray or red. Both coat colors may feature distinctive mottling or speckling patterns. ACDs have immense work drive and excel at controlling and, of course, moving livestock. Their boundless energy and supple gait make them excellent running partners. ACDs are true-blue loyal, famously smart, tenacious, ever alert, and may be wary of strangers. If an ACD isn't challenged, it easily becomes bored and may get into mischief. "

        description: "Beneath the one-of-a-kind coat is a large, muscular shepherd dog of ancient pedigree. But, since the coat is the breed's hallmark, let's take a close look. The Bergamasco Sheepdog has hair of three different textures that form naturally occurring loose mats, or 'flocks' (strands of hair woven together, creating flat layers of felted hair), covering the body and legs. The flocks provide protection from the fierce cold and wild predators of the Italian Alps, the breed's ancestral homeland. Bergamascos are bright, loyal, loving, and trainable' with a dash of mountain-dog independence. They take to watching over loved ones with a serene vigilance. Wary of strangers until properly introduced, Bergamascos are aggressive only as a last resort."

        description: "These bright and self-assured herding dog of medium size, known to be affectionate and possessive with loved ones. Lots of hard work and challenging play is heaven for this tireless, do-it-all dog. The Belgian Tervuren is characterized by a straight and abundant coat, an elegant but muscular frame, a proudly carried head, an alert and intelligent demeanor, and an insatiable work drive. The Terv's coat furnishings, like the sporty 'collarette'¬ù around the neck, are more profuse on males, who run larger than females. 'Their intelligence and high activity level can be a challenge for the less creative individual who may not understand the breed's need to work, warns one longtime owner. "
